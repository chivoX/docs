# FAQ - Data Credits

### Data Credits are required to send data over the Helium Network.
 
If youâ€™re a Hotspot owner, you generally do not need to worry about Data Credits unless you also plan to build sensors/devices to transmit data.  Data Credits used for transaction fees, adding miners, and asserting location, are burned automatically through the app from the available HNT in your wallet.  No additional steps are needed! (Read more on this Implicit Burn here)
 
One Data Credit equals 24 bytes of payload. Any number that exceeds 24 bytes is rounded up, so a packet with a 25-byte payload would cost the same as one with 47 bytes, i.e., two Data Credits.
 
The price of Data Credits is fixed in USD. Data Credits are non-transferrable, and can only be used by their original owner. Data Credits cannot be re-sold or traded. Data Credits are similar to pre-paid cellphone minutes or airline miles.
