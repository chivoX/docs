# FAQ - Build On Network

### I want to use the Helium Network for my IoT project, how do I learn more?
Thanks for your interest! Check out or join the community Discord server as there are several channels dedicated to development. There’s also a ton of documentation on development and use for you, ready to peruse here: https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network

### Can end devices communicate directly with each other or do they have to hop over the Helium Hotspot?
All compatible devices communicate via hotspots. There is no direct communication or meshing in our network.

### Will Helium be proprietary?
We believe proprietary protocols and technologies stifle innovation. This is why we use commodity, open-standard hardware, and modules available from dozens of vendors. Even our software is open-sourced. Check out our Open-Sourced documentation.

### Which frequencies does the Helium Hotspot use? Are you evaluating other frequencies in different countries?
We use sub-ghz unlicensed spectrum which varies country by country.  You can also view the frequency used per country here: https://docs.helium.com/lorawan-on-helium/frequency-plans/

### What kind of data rates do you anticipate going from device to the hotspot?
The applications we’re targeting for traffic typically within 5 kbps.
