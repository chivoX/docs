# FAQ - Hotspot Resellers

Authorized Resellers (“Makers”)
There's no harm in shopping around before making a purchase.  That said, it is important to know what risks may be involved when buying something from a 3rd-party.
- Please be very careful if purchasing a Helium Hotspot from a non-authorized seller.  Hotspots can be transferred from one Helium wallet to another.  Once they are added to the blockchain, only the owning wallet can transfer it to another. Any transfers are solely between the two entities ("Buyer" and "Seller"), and Helium is not involved.
- Also note that the Helium Hotspot limited warranty is only valid for the original sale to the original owner.  Resold Helium Hotspots from anyone other than Helium directly are not under any warranty whatsoever.  Please refer to their documentation for any authorized reseller policy.

As of late 2020, Helium no longer manufactures Hotspots directly, and the Network relies now on approved 3rd party manufactures we call Makers. 
Here is the current list of Makers for Helium-compatible miners. Note that since they all operate their own store with their own products, 
all questions about products, orders, or regional availability, will need to be sent to them directly.  They can be reached through their 
websites or their channel in our community Discord chat:

- Cal-Chip Connected Devices or in the #cal-chip channel.  
- Nebra or in the #nebra channel.  
- SyncroB.it or in the #syncrobit channel  
- Easylinkin or in the #bobcat channel  
- Parley Labs or in the #parely-labs channel  
- Kerlink or in the #kerlink channel
